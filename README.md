# Kitchen-Ingredients-System
To build a smart kitchen ingredient monitoring system using embedded components like
Arduino, load cell, and sensors. The system will alert users when a stored ingredient (e.g.
flour, sugar, rice) drops below a threshold but our focus is on sugar.
Many people especially students, working individuals, and busy families often run out of
essential kitchen ingredients without realizing it. Manual checking is time consuming and
inefficient, leading to last-minute shortages and inconvenience.
This project is highly feasible for students, both technically and financially. All required
components like Arduino, load cell, and buzzer are easily available in local markets or online.
